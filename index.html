        <h2>The Lyrebirds Podcast: Don't F*uck With Cats</h2>
        <p class="description">It is no secret that social media has had an intense effect on the ways that people view the world around them. In terms of serious matters, including crime coverage and the opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception. A discussion between students, who are very aware of the media and how it works and how the use of social media has had an effect on well-known crimes of the past, showcases just how this trend can continue to affect the motions and outcomes of crimes of the future.

<h2>My 1 minute video</h2>
<p class="description">When covid first hit, and people had to stay inside all day. I decided, like many others, to start baking. I decided to learn to make deserts from all over the world. I made pies, crème brûlée, mochi, baklava, belgian wafles, and coconut jelly. Coconut jelly is a desert that is traditional to China, I am not sure what the correct name of it is, but it sure is a good desert. It is super easy to make and fun to eat! <a href="linktoyoursoundcloud.com">1 minute video</a>.</p>
